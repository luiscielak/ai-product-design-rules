    - Images: [IMG:w×h], Avatars: (O), Icon: [*], Button: [Button: Label]
    - Inputs: [Input: Placeholder], Select: [Select: Value], Checkbox: [x] Label
    - Sections labeled with [S1], [S2] ...; notes as [A1], [A2]...
  - Legend (legend.md):

    - Annotations: A1:, A2: (content rules, empty/long states)
    - Flow Hooks: Next/Prev screen references
- Acceptance:
  - Every FR in PRD has at least one corresponding screen/section.
  - Shows empty, loading, and error states for core interactions.

## Rule: Product Designer → Generate Mid‑Fidelity Wireframes
- Command: /midfi
- Role: Product Designer
- Purpose: Define structure, hierarchy, and interaction states; introduce systemized spacing and type; still minimal visual brand.
- Required Inputs:
  - screens (from lo‑fi), states (default: default/hover/focus/disabled/loading/error/success)
  - content_examples (short/long), accessibility_targets (WCAG AA)
- Behavior:
  - Convert each lo‑fi screen into mid‑fi with componentized layout, spacing scale, and type scale.
  - Provide a token spec aligned to Tailwind and shadcn defaults.
  - Generate a mid‑fi `ui.html` overview that previews each screen in device frames: a phone frame for mobile and a browser frame for desktop.
- Output:
  - Directory: projects/{project_name}/docs/wireframes/midfi/
  - Files:
    - tokens.md (foundations)
    - components.md (component variants/states)
    - screens/<screen>.md (annotated frames and interactions)
    - ui.html (mid‑fi overview page linking tokens/components/screens, showing each screen in phone and browser device frames)
  - tokens.md includes:
    - Spacing: 0, 2, 4, 6, 8, 12, 16, 24, 32 (map to Tailwind: 0, 0.5, 1, 1.5, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8)
    - Typography: text-xs/sm/base/lg/xl/2xl; line-heights; weights
    - Color: neutrals, brand, semantic (map to Tailwind + shadcn themes)
    - Radius: sm/md/lg/full; Shadows: sm/md/lg
  - components.md:
    - Inventory (Button, Input, Select, Card, Dialog, Sheet, Toast, Tabs, Pagination, Table, Navbar, Sidebar)
    - Each: anatomy, states, props, interactions, keyboard navigation, focus order
  - screens/<screen>.md:
    - Frame description (grid, layout, spacing), component instances with props, state table, transitions and error handling.
- Acceptance:
  - All interactive elements have defined states and focus styles.
  - Accessibility notes for color contrast and keyboard support included.
  - Each screen preview includes device frames: phone (mobile) and browser (desktop) in `ui.html`.

## Rule: UI Designer → High‑Fidelity UI Design Kit
- Command: /hifi
- Role: UI Designer
- Purpose: Deliver a comprehensive hi‑fi UI design kit ready for engineering handoff, combining design system documentation with mobile-first UI designs.
- Required Inputs:
  - theme (light|dark|both, default: dark), brand_color (hex/HSL), accent_color (hex/HSL)
  - components (list, default: shadcn core used in project)
  - app_concept (optional: for mobile UI design focus)
  - key_features (optional: for mobile UI design focus)
  - target_users (optional: for mobile UI design focus)
- Behavior:
  - Map product tokens to Tailwind/shadcn CSS variables; document color roles and states.
  - Generate a static component gallery with device frames (phone + browser) showing key variants and states.
  - Include layout density, elevation, motion, and accessibility checklists.
  - If mobile UI focus is requested, create mobile-first designs following design principles.
- Design Principles (for mobile UI focus):
  - Balance elegant minimalism with functional design
  - Use soft, refreshing gradient colors aligned with brand palette
  - Have well-proportioned white space and clean layouts
  - Create light and immersive user experience
  - Establish clear hierarchy through subtle shadows and modular cards
  - Maintain natural focus on core functionalities
  - Use refined rounded corners
  - Include delicate micro-interactions
  - Ensure comfortable visual proportions
- Technical Requirements (for mobile UI focus):
  - Design for 375x812px mobile viewport with device frames
  - Use background-free vector icons from online libraries
  - Source open-source images with direct links
  - Style using Tailwind CSS via CDN
  - Exclude mobile status bars and system indicators
  - Avoid non-mobile UI elements like scrollbars
  - Use only black or white text
- Output:
  - Directory: projects/{project_name}/docs/ui-design/
  - Files:
    - theme.md (CSS variables and Tailwind mapping examples)
    - color-roles.md (neutrals, brand, semantic; usage and contrast notes)
    - component-gallery.html (interactive preview of core components in device frames)
    - layout-guidelines.md (grid, spacing, elevation, motion)
    - accessibility-checklist.md (WCAG AA essentials, keyboard/focus)
    - mobile-ui-design.html (mobile-first UI designs with device frames, if mobile focus requested)
- Acceptance:
  - Component gallery renders primary variants and states for Button, Input, Select, Checkbox, Card, Tabs, Table; Dialog preview included.
  - Device frames present for mobile and desktop previews.
  - Theme variables align with tokens and are implementable in Tailwind/shadcn without refactoring.
  - If mobile UI focus: horizontal UI.html with all app screens, following design principles and technical requirements.

  ## Rule: UI Engineer → Generate Clickable Prototype (shadcn + Tailwind)
- Command: /ui-proto
- Role: UI Engineer
- Purpose: Implement a runnable prototype with shadcn/ui components and Tailwind, covering primary flows.
- Required Inputs:
  - framework (default: Next.js 14+ App Router), package_manager (npm|pnpm|yarn), ts (default: true)
  - pages (list), components (from mid‑fi), routes/flows, data (mock or live), theming (light|dark|both)
- Behavior:
  - Detect existing Next.js/Tailwind; otherwise scaffold with safe defaults.
  - Configure Tailwind and shadcn/ui; map tokens from mid‑fi to Tailwind config when feasible.
  - Build pages and flows with real keyboard/focus management and basic form validation.
- Output:
  - Codebase changes:
    - If new: create Next.js app in projects/{project_name}/app/, Tailwind, and shadcn/ui setup
    - Install and add shadcn components per components.md
    - Implement routes and pages matching screens; basic mock data and API stubs
  - Deliverables:
    - projects/{project_name}/app/README-proto.md with:
      - Setup commands
      - Component list installed
      - Routes implemented
      - Known gaps and next steps
  - Standard Setup Commands (adjust to existing project):
    - Create app (if needed):
      - npx create-next-app@latest projects/{project_name}/app --ts --eslint --src-dir --app --tailwind --no-import-alias
    - Tailwind (if not created by the scaffold):
      - npm install -D tailwindcss postcss autoprefixer
      - npx tailwindcss init -p
      - Configure content to src/**/*.{ts,tsx} or app/**/*.{ts,tsx}
    - shadcn/ui:
      - npx shadcn@latest init -y
      - npx shadcn@latest add button card input label form select dialog sheet toast tabs table navigation-menu dropdown-menu tooltip avatar badge skeleton pagination textarea checkbox radio-switch
- Implementation Guidelines:
  - Use App Router, colocation in app/(routes)/, and server components where natural.
  - Keep components in components/ui aligned with shadcn conventions.
  - Use Tailwind utility classes and extracted class-variants when complexity grows.
  - State: minimal client state (React), mock data via /app/api routes or local fixtures.
  - Accessibility: use proper roles, labels, and focus management; ensure contrast AA.
- Acceptance:
  - Project runs: npm run dev
  - Core flows clickable end‑to‑end with loading/empty/error states.
  - No TypeScript or ESLint errors; basic responsiveness for mobile and desktop.
  - Keyboard navigation works for interactive controls; focus outline visible.
